      <h2>Getting Started with SaltStack</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Minion - is a machine running the salt-minion daemon.  It authenticates with a
    salt "master" and then accepts commands from master (or in some cases, from other
    minion.)</li>
        <li>Pillar - is a location where sensitive or specific information can be stored.
    A pillar is a relative store of information that can be made available to
    global or local minion.</li>
        <li>Grain - is a named pillar object.  A grain can contain key-values, lists, etc.
    I think of it as a configuration object.  Grains seemed can be nested. Grains,
    in Pillar, are a great place for global and local config data such as passwords,
    service paths, etc.</li>
        <li>State - is a specification of a state--the state of a service, a package, a user,
    a file, a directory, etc.  States are setup and enforced on minion who are
    targeted in a top file (top.sls) or salt state command.
